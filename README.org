* Synth
A WIP synthesizer in C.

* Quick start
Depends on [[https://www.libsdl.org/index.php][SDL2]]

#+begin_src console
$ git clone https://github.com/shoumodip/synth
$ cd synth
$ make
$ ./synth "A400 B330 E456 D300 C444"
#+end_src

* Usage
*NOTE:* This is a WIP application. The usage will change drastically
over time till it stabilises.

#+begin_src console
$ ./synth "<NOTE><MILLISECONDS> [<NOTE><MILLISECONDS>]"
#+end_src

I am assuming you have a [[https://www.instructables.com/Keyboard-Basics/][basic idea of keyboards]].

- ~NOTE~ is the white note (any character from ~A~ to ~G~)
- ~MILLISECONDS~ is the time in milliseconds for the note

For example:

#+begin_src console
$ ./synth "A400"
$ ./synth "A400 d330" # Case doesn't matter
$ ./synth "A400 B330 E456 D300 C444"
#+end_src
