* Synth
[[./demo.png]]

A WIP synthesizer in C.

* Quick start
Depends on [[https://www.libsdl.org/index.php][SDL2]]

#+begin_src console
$ git clone https://github.com/shoumodip/synth
$ cd synth
$ make
$ ./synth
#+end_src

* Usage
As of now, ~synth~ only plays notes in Octave 4 (~C4~ to ~B4~). The
keys in the home row are used to trigger the notes.

| Key | Note |
|-----+------|
| ~a~ | C4   |
| ~s~ | D4   |
| ~d~ | E4   |
| ~f~ | F4   |
| ~j~ | G4   |
| ~k~ | A4   |
| ~l~ | B4   |

Pressing the letter ~q~ exits ~synth~.
